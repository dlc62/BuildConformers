# BuildConformers
Python code to exhaustively enumerate all possible conformers of aliphatic molecules, eliminating sterically-forbidden conformers during the process. Can be used for molecules with up to ~ 20 rotatable bonds, depending on the degree of steric crowding. 
Specialised code provided for adding on allyl substituents to the end of alkyl chains in build_DADMA.py
